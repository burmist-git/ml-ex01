%% Machine Learning Online Class - Exercise 3 | Part 2: Neural Networks

%  Instructions
%  ------------
% 
%  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
%  linear exercise. You will need to complete the following functions 
%  in this exericse:
%
%     lrCostFunction.m (logistic regression cost function)
%     oneVsAll.m
%     predictOneVsAll.m
%     predict.m
%
%  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
%  or any other files other than those mentioned above.

%% Initialization
clear ; close all; clc

% Load Training Data
fprintf('Loading and Visualizing Data ...\n')

load('ex3data1.mat');
m = size(X, 1);

%% ================ Part 2: Loading Pameters ================
% In this part of the exercise, we load some pre-initialized 
% neural network parameters.

fprintf('\nLoading Saved Neural Network Parameters ...\n')

% Load the weights into variables Theta1 and Theta2
load('ex3weights.mat');


pred = predict(Theta1, Theta2, X);
