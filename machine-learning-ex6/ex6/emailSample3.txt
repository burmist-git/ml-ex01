Dear all,

On Apr. 2nd, the IR gate door on E-hut roof was not completely closed
after several Belle II collaborators made an access. Due to this
accident, machine safety group had to do additional safety patrol.

I just heard that it happened again today.
Please please make sure the door is completely closed and locked,
after you leave the area.

Hiro
